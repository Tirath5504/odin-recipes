    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        French fries, also known as "fries" or "chips," are a popular and beloved side dish enjoyed worldwide. Made from freshly cut potatoes, they are typically deep-fried until golden and crispy on the outside, while remaining tender and fluffy on the inside. The perfect French fry strikes a balance between crispy texture and comforting taste. Often seasoned with salt, they can be served on their own or paired with various condiments like ketchup, mayonnaise, or gravy. Whether enjoyed as a quick snack or a delightful accompaniment to burgers and sandwiches, French fries have become an iconic and comforting indulgence for people of all ages.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="lower-roman">
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into even-sized sticks or strips. Rinse the cut potatoes in cold water to remove excess starch, then pat them dry with a kitchen towel.</li>
        <li>In a deep fryer or a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the oil to around 350째F (175째C) for the first fry.</li>
        <li>Fry the potatoes in batches for about 3-4 minutes or until they are partially cooked and just starting to turn golden. This step helps create a crispy exterior while retaining a soft interior.</li>
        <li>Remove the partially cooked fries from the oil and drain them on paper towels. Let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase the oil temperature to around 375째F (190째C) for the second fry.</li>
        <li>Fry the partially cooked fries in batches again for about 2-3 minutes or until they turn golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove the fully cooked fries from the oil and immediately season them with salt and any additional seasonings you prefer</li>
        <li>Transfer the seasoned French fries to a serving dish and serve them hot. Pair them with your favorite dipping sauces like ketchup, mayonnaise, or any other condiments you like.</li>
    </ol>
