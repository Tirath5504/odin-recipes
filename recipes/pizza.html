    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="lower-roman">
        <li>Mix flour, water, yeast, and salt to make the pizza dough. Knead it until smooth, then let it rise in a warm place, covered with a damp cloth, until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to a high temperature, usually around 450-500°F (230-260°C), or as specified in your recipe.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll out the dough into your desired pizza size and shape (round, square, or rectangular).</li>
        <li>Combine tomatoes, garlic, herbs, olive oil, and seasonings to make the pizza sauce. Spread it evenly over the rolled-out dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella (or your chosen cheese) over the sauce. Add your desired toppings, distributing them evenly.</li>
        <li>Optionally, drizzle a little olive oil over the toppings for extra flavor. Add herbs and spices like basil, oregano, thyme, or red pepper flakes to taste.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the pizza onto a preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake in the hot oven for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute. Slice it into desired portions and serve hot. Enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
