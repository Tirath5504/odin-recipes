        A burger, or hamburger, is a beloved American dish now enjoyed worldwide. It features a seasoned ground meat patty (commonly beef) grilled to perfection and sandwiched between two soft, toasted buns.

Customizable and versatile, burgers can be made with various meat or plant-based patties, allowing for endless combinations to suit different tastes. Often served with fries or coleslaw, burgers are a popular choice in fast-food chains, diners, and casual dining establishments, providing a delightful fusion of juicy meat, delicious toppings, and a satisfying bun.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="lower-roman">
        <li>Take the vegetable mash and gently shape it into patties, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Avoid overworking the meat to keep the patties tender.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the patties with salt and pepper or your preferred seasoning blend. Optionally, you can add other spices or herbs to enhance the flavor.</li>
        <li>Preheat a grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. Grease the cooking surface with a little oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on the hot grill or pan and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness (medium-rare, medium, well-done, etc.).</li>
        <li>If desired, place a slice of cheese on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking. Let it melt and become gooey.</li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
        <li>Lay the cooked patty on the bottom half of the bun. Add your desired toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or any other optional ingredients.</li>
        <li>Spread ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, or any other favorite sauces on the top half of the bun.</li>
        <li>Place the top bun on the assembled burger. Serve the burger hot and enjoy it with your favorite side dishes, like fries or a salad.</li>
